 I’m a self-taught full-stack developer that specializes in front-end development. I typically work with small business owners, or those intending to bootstrap a business, to help build or improve their e-commerce web presence.

If you couldn’t tell by the domain name of my portfolio’s website -- I’m a JavaScript fan. Despite the criticism it receives, which in some aspects is warranted, it is my personal belief that JavaScript will be a key language to know as the modern world and the way we interact with it continues to evolve alongside technology.

Experience
Apr 2016 To Present
Case Manager | Chugai

As a Case Manager, I wear many hats out of necessity. A successful project usually follows these steps:
        1. Determine whether the client would benefit from a CMS (Wordpress, Netlify, DatoCMS etc.) vs a full back-end.
        2. Determine whether the client needs a Web Application or if a static implementation will suffice.     
        3. Create a wireframe detailing the UI/UX.
        4. Create a static implementation of the project so that the client may interact with it.
        5. Make the static implementation responsive so that the client may approve the mobile design.
        6. if(webApp) { buildWebApp(); };
        7. Build the back-end, if one is needed.

The technologies I lean on most for front-end development tend to be floating around in the React ecosystem. And, for the back-end, I always utilize a serverless microservices architecture. This includes heavy usage of AWS and services like SendGrid, etc.

As for CMSes, I’m a big fan of headless CMSes. DatoCMS is my go-to solution, due to its ease of use and its GraphQL endpoint.

Opticomp | Cooling and freezing equipment tender

This particular client provided a long-term project that required me to create a web application that could: 
        1. Provide a list of clients, display their information and their upcoming appointments.
        2. Create, add, update and delete clients to said list.
        3. Schedule appointments and send text messages and, or, emails to clients about said appointments.
